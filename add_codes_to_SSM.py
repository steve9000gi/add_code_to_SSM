""" add_codes_to_SSMs.py: Add the code for each node in each file in a
        directory of Coded Binary Link Matrices (CBLMs) to each corresponding
	node in each file in a directory of SSM .JSON files in a directory of
	System Support Maps (SSMs), and writes the results to a directory of 
	files of Coded SSMs (CSSMs).

    Usage:
    ./add_codes_to_SSMs.py ssm_dir cblm_dir cssm_dir

    Assumes that each SSM in ssm_dir has a corresponding CBLM file in cblm_dir,
    and that the files for all three directories follow this naming convention:
        SSM : "<name>.json"
        CBLM: "<name>-CBLM.csv"
        CSSM: "<name>-C.json"
    where <name> is a string that may or may not be constructed according to a
    convention defined in
    https://github.com/steve9000gi/extractMaps/blob/master/README.md.
